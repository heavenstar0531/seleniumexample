SeleniumExample
===============

This solution demonstrates testing web pages with Selenium and C#. It can also be used as a baseline template for new Selenium test projects.

Two tests are included that test web pages of the publically available demo website for vulnerability testing Altoro Mutual - http://demo.testfire.net/. The tests test logging onto the website and transferring an amount between two accounts.

The tests currently only work with the FireFox driver, therefore Firefox must be installed on your system. 

To run the Selenium tests, download the solution and run the NUnit tests. All selenium dependencies are included in the solution. Run the NUnit tests using ContinuousTests ( http://continuoustests.com ), Resharper ( http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper ) or NUnit ( http://www.nunit.org ).
